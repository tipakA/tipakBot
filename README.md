# tipakBot

This is a repository into which i'm going to rewrite my bot in TypeScript. Doing so should give me enough perspective on the language to have any way to back up or change my claims i so far made about it.

Rewriting will take a while considering amount of code to rewrite. Additionally, not everything is going to be as straight-forward as it would be if it was regular JavaScript project.
